# Spatial Accessibility and Statistical Analysis of Chicago Primary Care Network 

We design develop spatial analysis methods and perform statistical analysis on demographic data to extract information about primary care accessibility in Chicago.
This will help us understand the current challenges and needs in Chicago from both society and industry perspectives. 
Our final goal is to provide practical solution strategies to decision-makers for solving the issues and improving equal access to primary care centers with public transportation.


Any recommendation or suggestion is welcome, I would love to hear your feedback.
